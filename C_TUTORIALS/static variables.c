//Value Retention: Each time the incrementAndPrint function is called, the value of count is incremented by 1 and printed. The key point is that count retains its value between function calls.

//So, when incrementAndPrint is called multiple times:

//The first call initializes count to 0, increments it to 1, and prints 1.
//The second call retains the value 1, increments it to 2, and prints 2.
//This behavior is different from a non-static local variable, which would be re-initialized to 0 each time the function is called, resulting in the output always being 1
