//Immediate Printing and Freeing Memory:
// Memory Usage: Only the memory for the current ID is allocated at any given time.
// Storing All IDs and Printing Together:
// Memory Usage: Memory for all IDs is allocated and held until all IDs are printed.
// Example: If you store three IDs, you need memory for all three IDs simultaneously until you print and free them.
// Example: If you input an ID, print it, and then free the memory before moving to the next ID, you only need memory for one ID at a time.
